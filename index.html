    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a game developer with experience working in both Unity and Unreal Engine,
        focused on gameplay programming, interactive systems, and real-time simulations.
        My work spans mobile and PC games, multiplayer mechanics, AI-driven behavior,
        and VR-based simulation projects. I enjoy building systems that combine strong
        technical foundations with engaging user experiences, whether for entertainment,
        training, or simulation-focused applications.
